Process recent .lua file: Opens your last processed files so you can run them again quickly.

Scan game library: Lets SteaMidra find games in your Steam libraries.

Settings: Change Steam path, GreenLuma folder, and other options.

**Keyboard**

You can type a number to jump to a menu option. Escape or Back goes back. Ctrl+C exits.

**Important files**

Settings are stored in `settings.bin`. Recent files are in `recent_files.json`. If something goes wrong, check `debug.log` in the SteaMidra folder.
