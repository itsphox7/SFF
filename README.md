# ⚠️ Important Update!

Steam has updated and if you accidentally update your Steam client to a version after **10/03/2026** then GreenLuma won't work! Use this command to revert your Steam version:

```
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steam.exe" -forcesteamupdate -forcepackagedownload -overridepackageurl http://web.archive.org/web/20260122074724if_/media.steampowered.com/client -exitsteam
```

# SteaMidra (Education purposes only)

"Made" by Midrag and his brother!

Quick thing before we start remember to exclude the SteaMidra folder from Windows Security or at least the folder in this path for Creaminstaller Resources to work! `sff\dlc_unlockers\resources`

SteaMidra helps you set up games to work with Steam using Lua scripts, manifests, and GreenLuma. It writes the right files into your Steam folder so games and DLC can run. It does not replace or crack Steam itself.

**Need help?** Check the [documentation](docs/README.md) or reach out to me Merium0 on the Discord and we'll sort it out. Discord server: https://discord.gg/yp3UA6QdBC

## Quick start

### Step 1: Install dependencies

**Two commands are required** (steam has a stale `urllib3<2` constraint that conflicts with Selenium; `--no-deps` bypasses it — steam works fine at runtime with urllib3 2.x):

```batch
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install steam==1.4.4 --no-deps

Also run the install_online_fix_requirements.bat
```

If you get dependency conflicts with other projects on your system, use a virtual environment:

```batch
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install steam==1.4.4 --no-deps

Also run the install_online_fix_requirements.bat
```

### Step 2: Run SteaMidra

**With Python:**
- CLI: `python Main.py`
- GUI: `python Main_gui.py`

**With the EXE:**
- CLI: Run `build_simple.bat`, then run `SteaMidra.exe` (administrator preferred).
- GUI: Run both install commands from Step 1, then `build_simple_gui.bat`, then run `SteaMidra_GUI.exe`.

### Step 3: GreenLuma

Download GreenLuma and set it up: https://www.up-4ever.net/h3vt78x7jdap

Extract the ZIP and use the AppList folder from GreenLuma when SteaMidra asks for it. Full steps are in the [Setup Guide](docs/SETUP_GUIDE.md).

**Optional:** Windows desktop notifications: `pip install -r requirements-optional.txt`

## GUI Version

SteaMidra has a full graphical interface.

**Run with Python:** `python Main_gui.py`

**Build the GUI EXE:**
1. Install dependencies (two commands — both required):
   ```batch
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install steam==1.4.4 --no-deps
   ```
2. Run `build_simple_gui.bat`
3. Run `dist\SteaMidra_GUI.exe`

**What the GUI gives you:**  
- Pick your game from a dropdown (all Steam libraries scanned) or set a path for games outside Steam.  
- All actions as buttons: crack, DRM removal, DLC check, workshop items, multiplayer fix, **Fixes/Bypasses (Ryuu)**, DLC unlockers, and more.  
- Lua/manifest processing, AppList management, Steam patching, and library tools all accessible from buttons.  
- Full settings dialog where you can edit, delete, export, and import all settings.  
- Light and dark themes.  
- **Multi-language support** — switch between English and Portuguese in Settings (more locales can be added).  
- Log output shown in the window so you can see what's happening.  
- Any prompts that would normally appear in the terminal show up as dialog boxes instead.

The CLI version (`Main.py` / `SteaMidra.exe`) still works exactly the same as before.

## What SteaMidra can do

- Download and use Lua files for games, download manifests, and set up GreenLuma.  
- Write Lua and manifest data into Steam's config so games work with or without an extra injector.  
- Other features: multiplayer fixes (online-fix.me), **game fixes/bypasses (Ryuu)**, DLC status check, cracking (gbe_fork), SteamStub DRM removal (Steamless), AppList management, and DLC Unlockers (CreamInstaller-style: SmokeAPI, CreamAPI, Koaloader, Uplay).  
- **Multi-language GUI** — English and Portuguese built-in; add more via `sff/locales/`.
- Parallel downloads, backups, recent files, and settings export/import.

### AppList profiles (GreenLuma limit workaround)

GreenLuma has a hard limit of 130–134 App IDs. To use more games, use AppList profiles:

1. **Manage AppList IDs** → **AppList Profiles** (CLI) or the profiles option in the GUI
2. **Create profile** – creates an empty profile. Switch to it before adding more games.
3. **Switch to profile** – loads that profile's IDs into the AppList folder (truncated to the limit).
4. **Save current AppList to profile** – saves your current IDs into a profile (new or existing).
5. **Delete / Rename** – manage profile names and remove unused profiles.

When you reach 130 IDs, SteaMidra will remind you to create a new profile. Create an empty profile, switch to it, then add more games.

## Requirements

`requirements.txt` covers everything: CLI, GUI (PyQt6), online-fix (Selenium), and Tor fallback.

**Install with two commands:**
```batch
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install steam==1.4.4 --no-deps
```

The second command is needed because `steam==1.4.4` has a stale `urllib3<2` constraint that conflicts with Selenium 4.x. Steam only uses `requests` at runtime and works perfectly with urllib3 2.x — `--no-deps` simply skips the outdated constraint check.

More details in [INSTALL_DEPENDENCIES.md](INSTALL_DEPENDENCIES.md).

## Troubleshooting

**Steam says "No Internet Connection" when downloading** — This is a SteamTools issue where Steam can't reach the manifest endpoint. There are two ways to fix it:

1. **Quick permanent fix** — Run this in Win+R:
   ```
   PowerShell irm steamproof.net | iex
   ```
   Wait for it to finish. After this, Steam downloads will work normally. You can run it again to undo it.

2. **SteaMidra handles it automatically** — When you process a .lua file or use "Update all manifests", manifests are written directly to Steam's `depotcache` folder before Steam starts. Steam finds them locally and never needs to contact the endpoint.

**Dependency conflicts / urllib3 error** — Run both install commands from Step 1 above (requirements.txt first, then `pip install steam==1.4.4 --no-deps`). If conflicts persist with other projects on your system, use a virtual environment.

**ModuleNotFoundError** — Dependencies are not installed. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

**Remove SteamStub (Steamless) → WinError 2** — In the GUI, clicking "Remove SteamStub" now opens a file picker. Just navigate to your game folder and select the `.exe` yourself — no Steam API lookup needed.

**SteamAutoCrack not found** — Make sure the SteaMidra folder is intact and hasn't had any files deleted. SteamAutoCrack is bundled in `third_party/SteamAutoCrack/cli/` and should already be there.
